The integration flow between TPM and S/4HANA for supplier master data is designed to prevent the transmission of changes or updates for suppliers that are either blocked or marked for deletion. If such data is processed, it results in errors during synchronization with S/4.

To ensure smooth data flow and prevent processing errors, the following approach should be followed:

1. Pre-Check: Before initiating any changes to supplier master data in TPM, verify whether the supplier is currently blocked or marked for deletion.


2. Unblock/Remove Deletion Flag: If the supplier is blocked or marked for deletion, first remove the block or deletion indicator.


3. Process and Save Changes: Once unblocked, proceed with the intended changes or updates to the supplier data and save them.


4. Reapply Block/Deletion (if required): If the supplier still needs to be blocked or marked for deletion, apply the flag after the changes have been successfully processed and saved.



This sequence ensures data integrity and avoids errors during the synchronization process between TPM and S/4.
