Subject: FY26 Transfer Price Roll – Completion Update & Key Observations

Dear [Manager's Name / Team],

I would like to share an update on the FY26 Transfer Price Roll activity.

We successfully completed the transfer price loading for over 2,20,000 materials, covering more than 3,32,000 pricing conditions. Additionally, we processed 5.8 million+ ZSMD (Self-Manufactured Acquisition Cost) conditions as part of this effort.

Transfer price loading began on June 17th upon receiving confirmation and was completed by June 28th.

ZSMD condition loading, due to program inefficiency and the large volume, was completed on July 7th.


Key Challenges Encountered:

1. ZSMD Program Inefficiency:
We've been collaborating with IT over the past 10 months to improve performance. However, we are still awaiting an optimal resolution.


2. TPM Upload Limitation:
The TPM upload program can currently process only 25,000 records per transaction, significantly increasing upload cycles and monitoring overhead.


3. Validation Extract Constraints:
TPM validation reports are restricted to a single company code per execution, which affects efficiency when working across multiple company codes.



Next Steps:

Continue coordination with IT to resolve the ZSMD program performance issue.

Take up the TPM upload and validation extract limitations with IT and business stakeholders, aiming for enhancements before the next financial year cycle.


Please let me know if you'd like a more detailed walkthrough of the current gaps and the improvement roadmap we’re proposing.

Best regards,
Anil Kumar
